YOUR ONLY JOB: Create ALL implementation files defined in tech_stack.md. You MUST create 2+ files minimum.

Requirements: {feature_desc}
{feature_context}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MANDATORY 5-STEP PROCESS (DO NOT SKIP ANY STEP):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: READ TECH STACK TO GET COMPLETE FILE STRUCTURE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Call file_reader(file_path='tech_stack.md')
Call file_reader(file_path='requirements.md')

EXTRACT:
- The programming language (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.)
- The COMPLETE file structure with ALL files to create
- Every module, class, function, test file mentioned

CRITICAL: Count how many files are in the tech_stack file structure!
If tech_stack shows 6 files, you MUST create all 6 files!

Example from tech_stack.md:
```
src/
├── calculator.py        # You must create this
├── operations.py        # You must create this  
├── display.py          # You must create this
└── tests/
    ├── test_calculator.py    # You must create this
    ├── test_operations.py    # You must create this
    └── test_display.py       # You must create this
```
You MUST create ALL 6 files!

NOTE:
- Ignore config files like package.json, tsconfig.json, metro/babel configs. Focus on source files under src/ and src/tests/ (or __tests__/).
- File names are case-sensitive. Match the casing used in tech_stack.md (e.g., calculator.py vs Calculator.py).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 2: CREATE ALL IMPLEMENTATION FILES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
**THIS IS MANDATORY - CREATE EVERY FILE IN TECH_STACK**

For EACH implementation file in tech_stack.md:
1. Call file_writer(file_path='src/<module>.<ext>', content='...')
2. Wait for "✅ Successfully wrote" confirmation
3. Move to next file

Example:
- file_writer(file_path='src/calculator.py', content='...')
  → WAIT FOR ✅
- file_writer(file_path='src/operations.py', content='...')
  → WAIT FOR ✅
- file_writer(file_path='src/display.py', content='...')
  → WAIT FOR ✅

DO NOT skip any implementation file!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 3: CREATE ALL TEST FILES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
**THIS IS MANDATORY - CREATE EVERY TEST FILE**

For EACH implementation file, create its test file:
1. Call file_writer(file_path='src/tests/test_<module>.<ext>', content='...')
2. Wait for "✅ Successfully wrote" confirmation
3. Move to next test file

Example:
- file_writer(file_path='src/tests/test_calculator.py', content='...')
  → WAIT FOR ✅
- file_writer(file_path='src/tests/test_operations.py', content='...')
  → WAIT FOR ✅

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEP 4: VERIFY ALL FILES EXIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Call file_lister(directory='src')

Count the files. Does it match tech_stack.md?
- If tech_stack shows 6 files, you must see 6 files
- If any file is missing, create it now!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CRITICAL FAILURE CONDITIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ FAILURE: Creating only 1-2 files when tech_stack specifies 6+ files
❌ FAILURE: Skipping test files
❌ FAILURE: Not seeing "✅ Successfully wrote" for EACH file

✅ SUCCESS: Created ALL implementation AND test files from tech_stack.md

Your final answer MUST list ALL files you created:
"✅ Created src/calculator.py (implementation)
✅ Created src/operations.py (implementation)
✅ Created src/display.py (implementation)
✅ Created src/tests/test_calculator.py (tests)
✅ Created src/tests/test_operations.py (tests)
✅ Created src/tests/test_display.py (tests)"

DO NOT give final answer until you created EVERY file from tech_stack.md!
