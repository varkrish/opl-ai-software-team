Implement the '{feature_name}' feature completely using TDD methodology.

Feature: {feature_desc}
Feature Name: {feature_name}
{feature_context}

Design Specifications: {design_specs}

CRITICAL: Analyze the requirements FIRST to determine the appropriate technology stack:

- **Simple HTML/CSS/JS page?** 
  → Create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly
  → No backend needed, no Python, no APIs
  → Files: index.html, styles.css, script.js (or similar)
  → Test with manual browser testing or simple JS test files

- **Web application with backend API?**
  → Choose appropriate backend: Python (FastAPI/Django/Flask), Node.js, etc.
  → Create API endpoints, database models if needed
  → Files: src/ (backend code), tests/ (backend tests)

- **Static website?**
  → Use HTML + CSS + JavaScript
  → No server-side code needed

- **Command-line tool or library?**
  → Use appropriate language (Python, Node.js, etc.)
  → Create src/ and tests/ directories

IMPORTANT: If design specifications are provided, follow them closely:
- Use the architecture patterns specified
- Follow API contracts from design docs
- Adhere to database schemas if provided
- Implement according to technical specifications

IMPORTANT: Complete this ENTIRE feature before moving on. Do NOT start another feature.

Follow this complete cycle for THIS feature only:

1. **ANALYZE REQUIREMENTS**: Determine technology stack
   - Is this a simple HTML page? → Use HTML/CSS/JS
   - Does it need a backend? → Choose appropriate backend framework
   - What file structure is needed?

2. **WRITE TEST** (if applicable):
   - For backend code: Create/update test file in tests/ directory
   - For HTML/JS: Create simple test HTML or manual test checklist
   - Test should cover the main scenarios from the feature file
   - Use appropriate test runner (pytest for Python, jest for Node.js, manual for HTML)

3. **IMPLEMENT**: Create/update appropriate files
   - For HTML pages: Create index.html, CSS, and JavaScript files
   - For backend: Create/update source file in src/ directory
   - Write minimal implementation to make the test pass (if tests exist)

4. **TEST AGAIN**: Verify functionality
   - Run tests if applicable
   - For HTML: Verify it works in browser
   - All existing tests should still pass

5. **DOCUMENT**: Add documentation
   - Add comments, docstrings, or README as appropriate
   - Document how to use/run the code

Use file_writer to create/update files. Do NOT just describe - actually create the files!

Do NOT implement other features. Only work on '{feature_name}'.
