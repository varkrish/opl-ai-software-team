Analyze the user's vision and create comprehensive requirements.

User Vision: {vision}

Design Specifications: {design_specs}

IMPORTANT: If design specifications are provided, carefully review them and incorporate:
- Architecture decisions from design docs
- API specifications from API docs
- Database schemas from schema files
- UI/UX requirements from design files
- Technical constraints from technical specs
- Any other relevant design information

Your analysis should include:
1. User stories in the format: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
2. Gherkin scenarios for each user story using Given-When-Then format
3. Clear acceptance criteria
4. Technical requirements and constraints
5. Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)

CRITICAL - YOU MUST WRITE FILES TO DISK:

1. **MANDATORY**: Use the file_writer tool to save your complete requirements analysis to 'requirements.md'
   - This is REQUIRED, not optional
   - The file must be written to the workspace root: 'requirements.md'
   - Include ALL your analysis: user stories, Gherkin scenarios, acceptance criteria, technical requirements
   - Example: file_writer(file_path='requirements.md', content='[your full requirements document]')

2. **MANDATORY**: Extract all Gherkin scenarios and save them as separate .feature files in the 'features/' directory
   - Each user story should have its own feature file (e.g., 'features/addition.feature', 'features/subtraction.feature')
   - Feature files must follow proper Gherkin format:
     
     Example format:
     Feature: Addition
       As a user
       I want to add two numbers
       So that I can find their sum
     
       Scenario: Add two positive integers
         Given the calculator is ready
         When I enter "5" and "7"
         And I choose the "add" operation
         Then the result should be "12"
   
   - Use descriptive feature file names based on the functionality
   - Create one .feature file per user story/feature
   - Use file_writer tool for each feature file: file_writer(file_path='features/[name].feature', content='[gherkin content]')

REMEMBER: You MUST use the file_writer tool. Do not just return text - write files to disk!

Ask clarifying questions if the vision is ambiguous.
