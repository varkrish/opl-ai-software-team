Check for:
1. Completeness - Are all aspects covered?
2. Clarity - Are requirements unambiguous?
3. Testability - Can each requirement be tested?
4. Gherkin syntax correctness in both requirements.md and .feature files
5. Missing edge cases or error scenarios
6. Feature files exist in features/ directory and are properly formatted

IMPORTANT: Use the file_writer tool to save your validation report to 'validation_report.md'
