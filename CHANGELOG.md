Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).  
Version tags match container releases (`v2.x.y` → `quay.io/varkrish/crew-backend`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Frappe app generation E2E** — `simple_frappe_vision.json` in `test_simple_lang_standalone.py` asserts Frappe stack lock, real app slug wiring (not Go/`app_name`), and on-disk `hooks.py` / `modules.txt`.
- **Spring Boot simple fast E2E** — `simple_spring_vision.json` asserts Boot entrypoint + Maven/Gradle spring-boot deps and rejects Go/Frappe drift; tighten Go/Java artifact checks.
- **Multi-language simple fast E2E** — extend `test_simple_lang_standalone.py` with Go, HTML, and Node.js calculator fixtures alongside Python/Java.
- **Wiring contract / creation manifest pipeline** — contract-driven file manifests, language-neutral module identity sync from package manifests (`go.mod`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `build.sbt`, …), per-file TLDR enrich, and soft-register of concrete paths when completeness checks soft-fail.
- **`workflow_resolver`** — single pipeline resolver for YAML `workflows`, persisted `selected_workflow_phases`, and `smart_router` (adaptive only on first run). Plan-approve resume walks the resolved pipeline (`qa` before dev on full/TDD paths).
- **TDD QA phase** — QA materializes test `file_creation` tasks when pipeline places `qa` before build phases; dev skips those files after `qa_phase_completed`.
- **Feature-by-feature development** — when pipeline includes `product_owner`, dev runs one BDD feature slice at a time (related files, then feature implementation) instead of batching all features at the end.
- **Solutioning E2E** — `test_solutioning_e2e.py` runs the live research → architect → critique loop (`solution_approved=False`) and a second test that approves then resumes the full pipeline.

### Fixed
- **Skills own wiring layout** — Designer/TA/solution architect prompts no longer inject hardcoded Go/Frappe/Java wiring trees; FRAMEWORK SKILLS are authoritative, with a language-neutral fallback only when no skill matches.
- **Exclusive skill-family gating** — locked ``chosen_stack`` drops foreign framework skills (e.g. Frappe skills on Go/Java/Spring jobs).
- **Negated vision tech tokens** — ``no Go, no Flask, no FastAPI`` no longer pollutes ``chosen_stack`` / ``skills_query``.
- **Frappe flat↔nested reconciliation** — flat ``{app}/hooks.py`` satisfies nested contract declarations (and normalize no longer forces nested on top of flat).
- **Skills prefetch honors ``SKILLS_SERVICE_URL``** — Designer/TA `prefetch_skills` and solution research tools fall back to the compose env when YAML `skills.service_url` is unset; always write `skill_prefetch.json` (including skip/empty `_meta`) for workspace debugging.
- **Auto-approve skips solution review** — `_should_skip_solution_review()` honors `auto_approve_plan` / `auto_approve_solution`; job create mirrors plan auto-approve onto solution so Fast + auto-approve no longer pauses at solution review.
- **On-demand GitHub push** — detect GitPython rejected pushes; create-or-reuse the requested repo name and retarget `origin`; reuse existing repos on 422; native FastAPI `POST /api/jobs/{id}/push` with clear errors.
- **Stack wiring override** — skills/stack inject an authoritative STACK WIRING EXAMPLE that overrides generic wiring samples; normalize placeholder module/paths when they conflict with the locked stack.
- **Empty / island Python trees** — coerce string wiring symbols to structured objects; synthesize package `.files` from owns; re-lock wiring from `<wiring_patch>` before creation-manifest registration; soft-fail hardens when contract sources are missing (HTML/CSS count as implementation).
- **Python `src/`-layout import validation** — `PythonStrategy` also searches `src/`, `lib/`, and pyproject `where = [...]` so `from package import` no longer false-fails under src layout.
- **Tiny-project empty codegen** — adaptive `min_impl` (no hard floor of 4 files); soft-register any concrete source paths, not only contract-tier; wiring jq safety no longer rejects Python `def` inside signature strings; normalize map-style `.deps["x"] = ["y"]` to array-append form.
- **Module identity drift** — reject bare layer names (`api`, `src`, `service`, …) as import roots; sync `wiring_contract.module` / language from on-disk package manifests; `go mod tidy` before `go build` in compile smoke.
- **File-task / stub integrity** — prefer `file_creation` over feature-by-feature when a manifest exists; reject channel stubs on replace/patch writes; normalize wrong-language planned signatures (e.g. `def`→`func` for Go).
- **Solution critique approval** — a critique with non-empty `must_fix` can no longer count as approved; the loop continues until blockers are cleared or `max_passes` is reached. Saved critique JSON normalizes `approved` to `false` when `must_fix` is present. Shared `run_architect_critique_passes()` drives both initial solutioning and user refinement; pass stats persisted in job metadata.
- **TDD test task registration** — when `tech_stack.md` omits a `tests/` tree, derive test `file_creation` tasks from mirrored source paths and paths referenced in `test_plan.md`; QA materializes them per-file instead of a single chat fallback. `qa_phase_completed` is set only when no test file tasks remain pending.
- **LLM rate-limit (HTTP 429) resilience** — exponential backoff with `Retry-After` and provider reset timestamps; up to 15 retries (15 min wait) on `chat`/`achat`/`complete`/`acomplete` instead of failing file-creation tasks immediately.
- **Plan-approve resume** — no longer hardcodes `current_phase: development`; uses `resume_phase_after_plan_review()` from job metadata and config.
- **Resume checkpoint** — artifact inference and job-DB `current_phase` sync route through QA when TDD pipeline has not completed QA yet.

### Changed
- Designer / solutioning prompts — wiring patch examples use real import roots; language-neutral module identity rules documented in `wiring_contract.py` and `TESTING.md`.

## [2.4.5] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Manifest derivation from approved solution_spec** — `write_stack_manifest_from_solution_spec` now scans the approved spec for data/cache/persistence signals (Redis, Upstash, PostgreSQL, etc.) and unlocks the `database` forbidden tier when the spec explicitly selects one. Previously the manifest was derived only from the short vision text, so specs with Redis caching still forbade `database`, causing false Tech Architect failures.

## [2.4.4] - 2026-07-13

### Changed
- **Agent prompts** — structured output contracts, dead prompt files removed, backstory deduplication and review/validation verdict signals.
- **Dev infra** — `--no-access-log` on uvicorn/validator; pytest default timeout raised to 900s.

### Added
- **`test_prompt_improvements.py`** — unit tests locking prompt contracts after the enhancement pass.

## [2.4.3] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Forbidden-tier false positives** — negated mentions (`without database tier`) and substring noise (`orm` inside `formatting`) no longer fail Tech Architect stack validation.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Named-component extraction** — filesystem layout contracts (`/pages`, `src/api`, …) are excluded from named-component coverage; only real module names are checked. Folder layout remains enforced by concrete file-tree depth, not path hardcoding.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Stack manifest vs chosen_stack conflict** — technology-agnostic tier unlock: if `chosen_stack` already selects a tier, drop it from effective `forbidden_tiers` and do not re-apply vision overreach against the locked contract.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Pipeline-based workflow routing** — `_get_active_phases()` selects `fast` / `adaptive` / `full` phase lists; fast skips PO/Designer/Tech Architect and uses `seed_minimal_artifacts` before parallel development.
- **`capability_profile` API** — accepts string shorthand (`"fast"`|`"full"`|`"adaptive"`) or dict; Auto/default maps to adaptive inference.
- **Native FastAPI `/api/jobs/{id}/validation`** — authenticated validation report endpoint (no Flask header injection).

### Fixed
- Fast/Full job creation **422** — Pydantic model rejected plain-string `capability_profile`.
- Auto-detect never inferred — empty/unspecified path defaulted to `full` instead of vision-based adaptive.
- Fast mode produced **zero files** — task registration lived only in Tech Architect; seed phase now registers granular tasks and requires a parseable unicode file tree (with one strict retry).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Dynamic Workflow Routing** — Introduced `fast`, `adaptive`, and `full` workflow profiles. The `fast` lane bypasses the heavy multi-agent solution loop via `_run_fast_stack_decision()`, while the `full` lane retains the deep iterative review process with user approval.

### Changed
- Enhanced QA Agent test plan generation (`test_plan_task.txt`) to produce a comprehensive Markdown document with explicit `Test Strategy` and `Test Data Strategy` sections while preserving the execution configuration block for the test runner.

### Fixed
- Replaced `Dockerfile` requirements with `Containerfile` in Tech Architect prompts, resolving an issue where downstream DevOps agents would generate both files, enforcing compliance with Red Hat stack standards.
- Silenced noisy Uvicorn HTTP access logs (`--no-access-log`) for the `backend`, `validator`, and `skills-service` containers in both development (`dev-backend.sh`, `compose.dev.yaml`) and production (`Containerfile.backend`, `compose.yaml`) environments.
- **`_TEST_FILE_TIER` ordering bug** — test files were assigned tier 15 (below source-file default of 50), causing `earlier_tasks` to be empty when dependency inference ran; raised to tier 95 so test files are always registered after all source files, restoring correct test-to-source dependency wiring.
- **`append_tldr_tools` mock signature** — test mock lambda lacked `**kwargs`, causing `TypeError` when the new `config=` keyword argument was added to the call site.
- **`create_workspace_file_tools` tool count** — test asserted 5 tools; function now returns 6 after `bulk_file_writer` and `replace_file_content` were added; assertion and tool-name checks updated.
- **`TestBuildRunnerThreadLocal` import path** — `crew_studio` sits above the `agent/` test root; added autouse fixture to inject the parent directory into `sys.path` and suppress `ensure_llm_api_key` in unit-test context (no real API key required).
- **`test_skips_if_features_already_exist`** — stub feature content (`"Feature: Existing\n"`, 18 chars) failed `is_valid_gherkin_feature`'s `min_chars=40` + Scenario-structure check, causing the file to be deleted before the assertion; replaced with a complete valid Gherkin feature.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **Tech Architect 3-pass pipeline** — stack selection, file-level tree, and implementation plan are separate LLM calls with `reset_chat()` between passes. Reduces MaaS timeouts and improves artifact quality.
- **File-tree depth validation** — `validate_tech_stack_completeness()` rejects shallow directory-only trees; minimum implementation file count is derived from named components in `solution_spec` / `design_spec` (no hardcoded framework rules).
- **Pass 2 retry loop** — Tech Architect retries the file-tree pass up to 3 times with structural validation feedback before writing `tech_stack.md`.
- **`vision_stack_analysis` module** — technology-agnostic stack briefs, approved-solution contract formatting, and component reflection checks for architecture drift detection.
- **Approved solution contract** — when the user approves `solution_spec.md`, downstream agents (Designer, Tech Architect, workflow validation) treat it as binding; vision overreach checks are skipped.
- **Plain-path fallback parser** in `TaskManager._extract_files_with_descriptions` for tech stacks that list paths without Unicode tree characters.
- **`crew_studio/test_tech_architect.py`** — isolated Tech Architect runner for prod smoke tests; uses `user_llm_context()` so Settings → LLM credentials match live jobs.
- **Task-level transient retry** for 503 / network errors during the development phase.
- Unit tests: `test_approved_solution_contract.py`, `test_vision_stack_analysis.py`, `test_adaptive_stack_routing.py`, `test_stack_manifest.py`, shallow-tree validation cases in `test_code_quality.py`.

### Fixed

- **Solutioning pass 2 crash** — reset architect/critique chat history between passes (fixes Vertex/LiteLLM “tool role without previous assistant” 400).
- **Architecture drift** — Tech Architect no longer ignores approved `solution_spec.md`; structural mismatch detection and stack brief enforce the reviewed architecture.
- **Empty file-creation task list** — high-level directory trees no longer pass validation; orchestrator now requires concrete source filenames with extensions so `file_creation` tasks are registered per file.
- **BYOK / Settings LLM** — isolated scripts and jobs resolve credentials from `user_llm_configs` (Settings → LLM) via `user_llm_context()`; stale `config.yaml` fallback no longer used when BYOK is configured.
- **Solution agent chat reuse** — `reset_chat()` before each solutioning architect/critique pass.
- **Python package `__init__.py` blocked by manifest guard** — strict dev-phase allowlist now includes companion `__init__.py` paths for registered subpackage modules; vendor stubs (e.g. `mlflow/__init__.py`) remain rejected.

### Changed

- `define_tech_stack_task.txt` and Tech Architect pass 2 prompt require Unicode tree format with **file-level** entries (no folder-only lines).
- Workflow passes `design_spec` and `solution_spec` into tech-stack completeness validation.
- `detect_solution_spec_mismatch()` uses named-component extraction and path/slug reflection instead of brittle keyword rules.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Fail jobs early when LLM API key is missing or undecryptable BYOK key would overwrite server fallback with an empty Bearer token.

## [2.0.0]

Earlier releases: solutioning loop, plan review, BYOK LLM config, workflow prefs API, refinement flows. See git tags for details.
